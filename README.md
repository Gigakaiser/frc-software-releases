# FRC Software Releases
A big list of all the FRC team software releases from recent years!

Here's a few to get us started:

# 2015 season code

## Team 254: The Cheesy Poofs

> This yearâ€™s software includes new features such as a test harness and simulator code to run the program on a computer, web-based graphing tools, constants editor, and autonomous selection, blocking autonomous routines, and a controller that calculates and follows a trapezoidal motion profile, on the fly.

## Team 624: CRyptonite

>  This includes a library for using CAN Talons in LabVIEW with limited memory overhead, a scripted autonomous structure and text editor with a customizable programming language, and our version of Smart Dashboard which uses UDP instead of Network Tables. It also contains our offseason RGB lights code.

>  We experimented with Feed Forward and Motion Profiling in the fall. With some tuning, I was able to get our 2015 bot and a kitbot to go any distance I wanted without encoders (within an inch or two). I am still working on the integration with Feedback to make it more accurate and the latest code will be available on Github. This project may not be able to be opened until Kickoff because older versions of LabVIEW do not support projects built under Beta.

## Team 971: Spartan Robotics

> * Most of the stuff we modify year-to-year is written in C++ and Python
> * We use Python to design our controllers and generate raw matrices for our state feedback controllers that can be used with the C++ code directly. [Another thread diving into our control system code and theory is available here](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=129574)
> * We recently switched from an older build system based mainly on GYP files to Bazel, which is the publicly-available version of Google's build system
> * All robots included in this snapshot (2014 competition robot (Mammoth), 2014 3rd robot (Butterknife), 2015 competition robot (Subzero), and 2015 third robot (Robonauts?)) are up-to-date for the RoboRIO and other 2015 FIRST control system components

## Team 3081: Kennedy RoboEagles

> There are several good examples of combining state machines with the Command-Based Robot framework.

## Team 3620: The Average Joes

> Most of the code is pretty typical FRC code (complete with warts). There are a few unusual things in there, though, that other teams may find useful:
> 
> * event logging.
> * data logging.
> * UDP transmission of JSON encoded data to an onboard co-processor.
> * UDP reception of JSON encoded data from an onboard co-processor.
> * adding third party jars to the build.
